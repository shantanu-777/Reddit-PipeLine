# Reddit Pipeline

📊 **Reddit Pipeline** is an end-to-end data pipeline project designed to extract, transform, and analyze data from Reddit. This project leverages Python, data engineering tools, and cloud services to automate the process of gathering Reddit data and deriving meaningful insights from it. The system can be used for trend analysis, sentiment analysis, or even detecting emerging topics.

## 🔍 Overview

The **Reddit Pipeline** project focuses on building a robust data pipeline to fetch data from Reddit using its API, process it, and store the data in a structured format for analysis. The project helps businesses and researchers gain insights into user discussions, trends, and opinions across various subreddits.

## ✨ Features

- **Automated Data Extraction**: Uses Reddit API to gather posts and comments from specific subreddits.
- **Data Transformation**: Cleans, filters, and preprocesses data for analysis.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzes the sentiment of comments to determine positive, negative, or neutral opinions.
- **Data Storage**: Stores transformed data in a NoSQL database for efficient retrieval.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Designed to handle large volumes of data efficiently.

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Python, Flask
- **Data Engineering**: Pandas, NumPy, PRAW (Python Reddit API Wrapper)
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn, NLTK
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Cloud Services**: AWS S3, AWS Lambda
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub
